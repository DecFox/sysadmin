this is a demo of the munin master and slave roles.
it'll spin up 3 slaves and a master (which is also a slave).
the munins auth and talk to each other over tls.
the master serves graphs over nginx with tls and basic-auth.
annoyingly, for alerting (eg. sms), munin doesn't trigger
an alert if a slave is unreachable. so i included a cheeky
plugin that graphs the rate of ERRORs in the munin master
log. we can alert if that rate exceeds zero :)

run.sh is the toplevel thing. it complains if you forget the
aws key env vars, then runs the top.yaml ansible playbook.
that runs a few things:
* ec.yaml spins up instances (if necessary) and populates the
  ansible inventory.
* runs the master/slave ansible roles against the respective
  ec2 instances.

keys involved:
  keys from amazon:
    * AWS_ACCESS_KEY and AWS_SECRET_KEY
  keys generated with provided scripts:
    * ssh-key{,.pub}: you have to tell AWS about this one
      before you refer to it by name in the ec2.yaml script.
    * ssl key and cert for munin: slaves and master auth
      each other and talk privately.
    * ssl key and cert for nginx: talk privately to nginx.
    * http basic auth crypt() thing: auth to nginx.
